    <h2>This logo is designed for a front page on facebook. I have used green and yellow colors to emphasize more on freshness and organic products.
      By studying the organic stores around us I discovered the combination of these colors is going to grab more customerâ€™s attention for my client.
      I have avoided using fonts with serif to give an assuring feeling to those who visit my client's facebook.</h2>

    <h2>  This logo has the elements that I discovered are interesting for people that prefer to use organic products.
      It represents a cup of lime tea which is healthy and organic. The color gives the fresh feeling as a lime itself.
      I have used rounded shapes to communicate with customers that care about cruelty free products.</h2>
